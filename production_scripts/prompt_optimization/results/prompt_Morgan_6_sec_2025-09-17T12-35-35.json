Decision timeline: \"What's your timeline for implementing a solution like this?\"\n2. Budget exploration: \"Have you allocated budget for improving this area of your business?\"\n3. Decision process: \"Who else would be involved in evaluating a solution like ours?\"\n4.

Ask about concerns: \"May I ask what specific concerns you have about exploring a solution like ours?\"\n3. Address objections specifically: \"That's a common concern. Here's how we typically address that...\"\n4. Offer proof points: \"Would it be helpful to hear how another [industry] company overcame that same concern?\"\n\n### For Information Gatherers\n1.

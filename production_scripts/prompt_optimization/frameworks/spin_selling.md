# SPIN Selling Framework for Call Analysis

## Overview
SPIN Selling is a proven methodology for consultative selling developed by Neil Rackham. It focuses on asking the right questions in the right sequence to uncover customer needs and build value.

## The SPIN Model

### S - SITUATION Questions (10-15% of questions)
**Purpose:** Gather facts and background information
**Examples:**
- "How many machines are you currently running?"
- "What's your current production capacity?"
- "How long have you been with the company?"

### P - PROBLEM Questions (25-35% of questions)
**Purpose:** Identify problems, difficulties, and dissatisfactions
**Examples:**
- "What challenges are you facing with your current equipment?"
- "How often do you experience downtime?"
- "What's the biggest bottleneck in your operation?"

### I - IMPLICATION Questions (35-45% of questions)
**Purpose:** Explore consequences and implications of problems
**Examples:**
- "How does this downtime affect your production targets?"
- "What does each hour of lost production cost you?"
- "How is this impacting your ability to meet customer demands?"

### N - NEED-PAYOFF Questions (15-25% of questions)
**Purpose:** Build value and get customer to state benefits
**Examples:**
- "If we could reduce your downtime by 50%, what would that mean for your business?"
- "How important would it be to have 24/7 reliability?"
- "What would achieving these efficiency gains do for your team?"

# PROMPT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS TASK

You are an expert in analyzing conversational AI prompts for sales calls. Analyze the given assistant prompt and identify specific structural elements and their potential impact on call performance.

ASSISTANT DATA:
**Name:** {assistant_name}
**Average QCI Score:** {avg_qci}/100
**Performance Breakdown:**
- Dynamics: {avg_dynamics}/30
- Objections: {avg_objections}/20
- Brand: {avg_brand}/20
- Outcome: {avg_outcome}/30

**Call Volume:** {total_calls} calls analyzed

SAMPLE CALLS:
{sample_calls}

FULL ASSISTANT PROMPT:
{assistant_prompt}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

1. STRUCTURAL BREAKDOWN
Identify and analyze these prompt sections:
- Opening/Hook: How does the assistant start conversations?
- Value Proposition: How is the product/service presented?
- Discovery Questions: What information gathering approaches are used?
- Objection Handling: How are concerns addressed?
- Call-to-Action: How are next steps proposed?
- Brand Integration: How is "Young Caesar" incorporated?

2. PERFORMANCE CORRELATION ANALYSIS
For each structural element, assess:
- Effectiveness Rating (1-10): Based on QCI performance
- Specific Issues: What's causing low scores in each QCI category?
- Success Patterns: What works well in high-performing calls?
- Failure Patterns: What consistently leads to poor outcomes?

3. CATEGORY-SPECIFIC INSIGHTS
Dynamics Issues ({avg_dynamics}/30):
- Talk time balance problems
- Response flow issues
- Engagement quality concerns

Objections Handling ({avg_objections}/20):
- Recognition failures
- Compliance problems
- Alternative solution gaps

Brand Consistency ({avg_brand}/20):
- Brand mention timing and frequency
- Professional tone maintenance
- Young Caesar positioning

Outcome Achievement ({avg_outcome}/30):
- Meeting scheduling effectiveness
- Lead qualification quality
- Next steps clarity

## RECOMMENDATION_GENERATION

Used in: recommendation_engine.js
Purpose: Generate specific optimization recommendations and improved prompts

```
# PROMPT OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATION ENGINE

You are an expert prompt optimization specialist for VAPI conversational AI systems, specifically focused on industrial manufacturing cold calling campaigns for Young Caesar.

## CONTEXT & PERFORMANCE DATA:
**Assistant:** {assistant_name}
**Current Performance:** {avg_qci}/100 QCI Score
**Volume:** {total_calls} calls analyzed

**Current Scores:**
- Dynamics: {avg_dynamics}/30 (Talk ratio, flow, engagement)
- Objections: {avg_objections}/20 (Recognition, handling, alternatives)
- Brand: {avg_brand}/20 (Young Caesar mentions, consistency)
- Outcome: {avg_outcome}/30 (Meetings, leads, next steps)

## CORRELATION ANALYSIS INSIGHTS:
{correlation_analysis}

## CURRENT PROMPT:
{current_prompt}

## OPTIMIZATION TASK:

### 1. PRIORITY ANALYSIS
Rank improvement opportunities by impact potential:
- **HIGH IMPACT** (5-10 QCI point improvement potential)
- **MEDIUM IMPACT** (2-5 QCI point improvement potential)
- **LOW IMPACT** (1-2 QCI point improvement potential)

### 2. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
For each identified issue, provide:
- **Root Cause:** What's causing the problem
- **Proposed Solution:** Specific prompt changes
- **Expected Impact:** Projected QCI improvement
- **Implementation Complexity:** Easy/Medium/Hard

### 3. OPTIMIZED PROMPT CREATION
Create a complete optimized version addressing:
- **Flow Improvements:** Better conversation structure
- **Objection Handling:** Enhanced resistance management
- **Brand Integration:** Stronger Young Caesar positioning
- **Outcome Focus:** Clearer meeting scheduling approach

### 4. A/B TESTING STRATEGY
Design testing approach:
- **Test Variables:** What to change first
- **Success Metrics:** How to measure improvement
- **Timeline:** Implementation schedule
- **Risk Mitigation:** Fallback strategies

## ALEX HORMOZI FRAMEWORK REQUIREMENTS:

All recommendations MUST follow Alex Hormozi's Value Equation principles:
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)

**DREAM OUTCOME OPTIMIZATION:**
- Make the outcome more specific and compelling
- Use exact numbers and timelines
- Focus on transformation, not features

**PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD IMPROVEMENTS:**
- Add proof elements (case studies, testimonials)
- Reduce risk with guarantees/trials
- Increase credibility through authority

**TIME DELAY REDUCTION:**
- Show immediate value/quick wins
- Break down implementation into phases
- Demonstrate fast time-to-value

**EFFORT & SACRIFICE MINIMIZATION:**
- Simplify the process
- Remove friction points
- Make it "done-for-you" where possible

## YOUNG CAESAR CONTEXT:
- Industrial manufacturing focus
- B2B cold calling campaigns
- Target: 5 new clients monthly for drilling machines
- Professional, results-oriented brand voice
- Quality over quantity approach

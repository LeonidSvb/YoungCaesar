-- Migration: Fix calls_enriched view with boolean flags instead of categories
-- Date: 2025-10-24
-- Purpose: Replace abstract categorization with concrete boolean flags for frontend tabs
--
-- Changes from previous version:
-- - Remove call_category and quality_level (abstract entities)
-- - Add boolean flags: is_quality_call, is_short_call, is_voicemail, is_with_tools, is_not_started
-- - Add not_started_reason for error categorization (customer_unavailable, technical_error, other)
-- - Keep all QCI fields directly in main view (no separate QCI view)
--
-- Frontend will filter using:
-- - .eq('is_quality_call', true) for Quality tab
-- - .eq('is_short_call', true) for Short calls tab
-- - .eq('has_qci', true) for QCI filter
-- - .order('qci_score', { ascending: false }) for QCI sorting

-- STEP 1: Drop old incorrect views

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS quality_calls;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS error_calls;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS voicemail_calls;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS calls_with_tools;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS calls_enriched;

-- STEP 2: Create new calls_enriched view with boolean flags

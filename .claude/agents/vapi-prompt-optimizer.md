- **Assistant Information**: Current prompts and configurations
- **Optimization Goals**: Target improvements and business objectives

## Sub-Agent Architecture

### Sub-Agent 1: Data Processor
**Purpose**: Extract, aggregate, and structure VAPI call data for analysis

**Capabilities:**
- Load and validate VAPI call data and QCI results
- Extract assistant prompts from call messages
- Group calls by assistant ID and calculate performance metrics
- Create structured datasets with sample calls and performance profiles
- Filter assistants based on minimum call thresholds

**Process:**
1. Change directory: `cd production_scripts/prompt_optimization`
2. Validate file structure and dependencies
3. Use Bash tool to run: `node src/data_aggregator.js`
4. Validate output file creation and data quality
5. Prepare structured assistant profiles with QCI metrics

**Output**: Aggregated assistant data file with performance metrics and sample calls

### Sub-Agent 2: Performance Analyzer
**Purpose**: Analyze correlations between prompt structure and QCI performance

**Capabilities:**
- Deep analysis of prompt structure and effectiveness
- Correlation mapping between prompt sections and QCI categories
- Comparative analysis between high and low performers
- Pattern identification for successful conversation techniques
- AI-powered prompt structure evaluation

**Process:**
1. Validate prompts.md file exists and is properly formatted
2. Use Bash tool to run: `node src/performance_correlator.js`
3. Analyze prompt-performance relationships using GPT-4o
4. Identify structural weaknesses and strengths using centralized prompts
5. Compare successful vs. failing conversation patterns
6. Generate detailed correlation insights

**Output**: Correlation analysis with specific prompt improvement opportunities

### Sub-Agent 3: Optimization Engine
**Purpose**: Generate specific, actionable prompt optimization recommendations

**Capabilities:**
- AI-powered recommendation generation using GPT-4o
- Complete optimized prompt creation
- A/B testing plan development
- Implementation priority assessment
- Success metrics definition and tracking

**Process:**
1. Use Bash tool to run: `node src/recommendation_engine.js`
2. Generate priority-ranked recommendations for each assistant using centralized prompts
3. Create optimized prompt versions with specific improvements
4. Develop A/B testing strategies
5. Define success metrics and implementation timelines

**Output**: Complete optimization recommendations with ready-to-deploy prompts

## Master Agent Orchestration Logic

### Phase 1: Data Preparation & Validation
```
1. Change directory to: production_scripts/prompt_optimization
2. Validate module structure:
   - src/ folder exists with all 4 scripts
   - prompts.md file exists and is properly formatted
   - ../shared/ utilities are available
3. Validate input data availability (VAPI calls + QCI results)
4. Execute Sub-Agent 1: Data Processor
5. Verify aggregated data quality and assistant coverage
6. Proceed only if minimum data thresholds are met
```

### Phase 2: Performance Analysis
```
1. Execute Sub-Agent 2: Performance Analyzer
2. Review correlation analysis for quality and insights
3. Identify top optimization opportunities
4. Validate AI analysis results for business relevance
```

### Phase 3: Recommendation Generation
```
1. Execute Sub-Agent 3: Optimization Engine
2. Generate comprehensive recommendations and optimized prompts
3. Review recommendations for implementation feasibility
4. Prepare final deliverables and success metrics
```

### Phase 4: Dashboard Generation & Delivery
```
1. Execute Dashboard Generator: node src/dashboard_generator.js
2. Validate all outputs for completeness and quality
3. Calculate total cost and processing time
4. Generate executive summary with key findings
5. Create static HTML dashboard (GitHub Pages compatible)
6. Provide implementation roadmap and next steps
```

## Error Handling & Validation

**Data Quality Checks:**
- Verify minimum number of calls per assistant (5+)
- Validate QCI score calculations and distributions
- Check prompt extraction completeness
- Ensure AI analysis quality and relevance

**Process Validation:**

- Review success metrics for measurability

## Success Metrics & KPIs

**Primary Objectives:**
- Target QCI improvement: +15-25 points per assistant
- Processing time: <5 minutes for full analysis
- Cost efficiency: <$0.50 per assistant analyzed
- Recommendation quality: 95%+ actionable suggestions

**Output Quality Standards:**
- All assistants with 5+ calls receive recommendations
- Each recommendation includes specific prompt changes
- Optimized prompts ready for immediate deployment
- A/B testing plans with clear success metrics

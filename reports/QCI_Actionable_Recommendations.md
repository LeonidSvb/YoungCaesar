## üö® CRITICAL PRIORITY: Fix Brand Mentions (Zero Brand Score)

**Problem:** Multiple assistants are not mentioning "Young Caesar" brand at all, resulting in 0/20 brand scores.

### Assistants requiring immediate action:

**Assistant 35cd1a47** (396 calls, Brand: 0/20)
```
// Update system prompt for assistant 35cd1a47
// Add this to the beginning of your prompt:

"You are [NAME], a professional representative from Young Caesar.
ALWAYS introduce yourself as '[NAME] from Young Caesar' in the first message.
Example: 'Hi, this is Alex from Young Caesar. Quick question...'"

// Current issue: 396 calls with average Brand score of only 0/20
// Expected result: Brand score should increase to 15-20/20
```

**Assistant 10f76383** (222 calls, Brand: 0/20)
```
// Update system prompt for assistant 10f76383
// Add this to the beginning of your prompt:

"You are [NAME], a professional representative from Young Caesar.
ALWAYS introduce yourself as '[NAME] from Young Caesar' in the first message.
Example: 'Hi, this is Alex from Young Caesar. Quick question...'"

// Current issue: 222 calls with average Brand score of only 0/20

## üìä Fix High-Volume, Low-Quality Assistants

These assistants make many calls but with poor quality scores:

### Assistant 35cd1a47 (396 calls, QCI: 16.6/100)
```
// High-volume assistant 35cd1a47 needs immediate attention
// Current: 396 calls, QCI only 16.6/100
// Problem areas:
//   - Dynamics: 10.8/30 (should be 20+)
//   - Brand: 0/20 (should be 15+)
//   - Outcome: 4.3/30 (should be 15+)

// SOLUTION: Replace entire system prompt with proven template from 8a51eae6
// Then add specific improvements:

1. Brand mention: "Hi, this is [NAME] from Young Caesar"
2. Clear value proposition
3. Specific ask for contact information
4. Professional objection handling

// Expected improvement: QCI should increase to 40+ within 50 calls
```

### Assistant 10f76383 (222 calls, QCI: 14.9/100)
```
// High-volume assistant 10f76383 needs immediate attention
// Current: 222 calls, QCI only 14.9/100
// Problem areas:
//   - Dynamics: 9.6/30 (should be 20+)
//   - Brand: 0/20 (should be 15+)
//   - Outcome: 4.1/30 (should be 15+)

// SOLUTION: Replace entire system prompt with proven template from 8a51eae6
// Then add specific improvements:

1. Brand mention: "Hi, this is [NAME] from Young Caesar"
2. Clear value proposition
3. Specific ask for contact information
4. Professional objection handling

// Expected improvement: QCI should increase to 40+ within 50 calls
```

## üîÑ Optimize Prompt Variations

Some assistants used multiple names - analyze which performed better:

### Assistant 8a51eae6 used 5 different names
```
// Assistant 8a51eae6 used multiple names: Alex calling, Alex with young caesar, Alex with Young Caesar
// Current average QCI: 50.2/100

// ACTION NEEDED:
// 1. Export call data for this assistant
// 2. Segment performance by each name used
// 3. Identify which name variant performed best
// 4. Standardize on the best-performing variant
// 5. Update prompt to use only the winning name

// SQL-like analysis needed:
// SELECT name_used, AVG(qci_total), COUNT(*)
// FROM calls
// WHERE assistant_id = '8a51eae6'
// GROUP BY name_used
// ORDER BY AVG(qci_total) DESC
```

### Assistant 1a9692a3 used 43 different names
```
// Assistant 1a9692a3 used multiple names: Ivy Clark, Avery Martinez, Eleanor Young, [40 more names]
// Current average QCI: 38.1/100

// This suggests extensive prompt experimentation
// ACTION: Identify the top 3 performing names and standardize
```
